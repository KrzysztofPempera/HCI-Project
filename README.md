PIZZORDER
=========

## What is it?

Pizzorder is an app which allows you to create your unique pizza and order it! Everything what you have to do is choose your favorite ingredients and optional special offers. Of course Pizzorder can be develop by adding more ingredients, offers, promos and maybe sizes of pizza! 

## Why?
We created Pizzorder as a Django project for our 'Human-Computer Interaction' classes. That was first time we used Django, so it was challenging.

## How to run the Pizzorder?
All you have to do is cloning this repository using commands:

>> `git clone https://github.com/ziolek2609/Pizza_kck`

go in the folder:

>> `cd HCI-Project`

and then:

>> `python manage.py runserver`.

Now you can use Pizzorder in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.


*Hope you enjoy Pizzorder!*
